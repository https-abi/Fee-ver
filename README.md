# Fee-ver: Medical Bill Analyzer
Fee-ver is a specialized, AI-powered tool designed to analyze complex, post-treatment medical bills and Explanation of Benefits (EOBs) to flag potential errors, discrepancies, and overcharges. We address the chaotic financial blind spot that occurs *after* medical care, ensuring consumers are not overcharged due to billing confusion.

---

## Key Features

* **Itemized Error Flagging:** Utilizes an LLM to cross-reference billing codes against standard regional rates and service descriptions, highlighting specific questionable charges.
* **Zero-Persistence Security:** Built with an **ephemeral data model** to ensure no Protected Health Information (PHI) is stored or logged, prioritizing user privacy (HIPAA-ready design).
* **Simple Upload Interface:** Enables users to quickly upload photo of bill(s) for immediate, session-based analysis.
* **Discrepancy Reporting:** Generates a clear, actionable report detailing exactly *what* to dispute and *why*.

## 🏆 Hackathon Achievement

We are proud to have won **2nd Place** at the **Alibaba Cloud Philippines AI Hackathon** (2025). This recognition validates the critical need for transparent post-treatment financial auditing in healthcare.

## Technical Architecture

Fee-ver was built in 48 hours focusing on rapid prototyping and secure data handling.

### Data Security & Compliance Note
During the hackathon, we focused on **anonymity and zero data persistence** to respect PHI rules. Our planned next step is to transition to **Alibaba Cloud's security suite** to ensure full HIPAA compliance for a production environment.

---

## Future Roadmap (Post-Hackathon)

Our plan to evolve Fee-ver from a feature into a viable company:

1.  **Compliance:** Achieve full HIPAA compliance by migrating to Alibaba Cloud and completing a security audit.
2.  **Productization:** Develop the **'Fee-ver Monitor'** subscription service for continuous EOB processing and financial benchmarking (the path to recurring revenue).
3.  **B2B Integration:** Develop the public API endpoint for billing advocates and insurance partners (the path to offloading liability and large-scale revenue).
